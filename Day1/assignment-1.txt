Q1. Why dot use with Value Type?
Ans- In backend dot operator makes the wrapper object of the variable(auto boxing).
Example- 
         var z= 38 // value
         var z= new Number() // auto boxing

Q2. What is null value and where we use it? Hint : typeof
Ans- null represents an empty or unknown value.
     In JavaScript, it is used for referring absence of any object value.

Q3. Typeof ?
Ans- Typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns the data type of the operand passed to it. 

Q4. Null vs undefined
Ans- null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value. null is an object, null has no reference.
     A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined. it is declared but not assigned any value.

Q5 . == vs ===
Ans- '==' operator performs a loose equality comparison
     It compares the content of two types by considering them as of same types.
     it first do type conversion then compare. returns true if value is same and false if not.
Example-
      var a = 12;
      let b = "12";
      a==b;
output-true

'===' operator performs a strict equality comparison
It first checks if the two variables has same type if yes then it checks value of the two variables and if they are same too then it returns true.
if variables are not of same type then it returns false.
Example-
      var a = 12;
      let b = "12";
      a===b;
output-false
